GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN #4

THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER FOR A FIRST NUMBER 
AND IF IT IS A VAILD (A NUMBER). THEN IT WILL MOVE 
ONTO THE SECOUND NUMBER AND CHECK IF THAT TOO IS 
VAILD. IF THE USER HAPPENS TO TYPE IN ANY OTHER 
CHARACTER THAT ISNT A NUMBER THEN IT WILL ASK THEM 
TO TRY AGAIN AND TYPE IN A VAILD NUMBER, OTHERWISE 
IT WILL COUNTINE TO ASK THEM AND NOT MOVE ON. AFTER
COMPARING THE 2 NUMBERS AND DISPLAYING IT ON THE 
TERMINAL THE PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER IF THEY WANNA 
PLAY AGAIN. IF THEY ENTER ANY VARIATION OF 'YES' THE 
PROGRAM WILL RUN AGAIN. IF THE USER ENTERS 'NO' IN ANY 
VARATION THEN THE PROGRAM WILL END. IF THEY ENTER ANYTHING 
ELSE IT WONT BE VAILD AND THEY WILL BE ASKED AGAIN UNTILL
THEY TYPE YES OR NO.

The code looks great and it also looks organized, I like the validation because if someone trys to put something
that's not meant for, it will boot it out, great job, everything works great :)
